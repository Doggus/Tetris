Note to tutor:
Its a shame that Since I was so busy that I ended up neglegting this assignment but I enjoyed it nonetheless. 
Sadly I didnt have enough time to implement any new mechanic to the game (which was the part I was really excited for)
so there is no need to look out for that. I did however create a background, score tally and add music and sound effects to the base game. 
There is really nothing else noteworthy to say about my code so I will leave you to it. Enjoy the rest of your day.
